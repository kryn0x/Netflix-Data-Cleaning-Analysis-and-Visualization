Netflix Data Analysis Project

This project involves cleaning, transforming, and analyzing Netflix dataset to gain insights into the content available on the platform. The main objective is to understand patterns, trends, and distributions of movies and TV shows based on different attributes like type, release year, country, and genre.

Features & Highlights

Data Cleaning & Transformation:

Scaling numerical features where necessary.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

Visualizing distributions of movies and TV shows.

Identifying trends over the years.

Analyzing content availability by country and genre.

Visualization:

Interactive and static plots using libraries like Matplotlib and Seaborn.

Graphs include count plots, distribution plots, and trend analysis over time.

Tools & Technologies:
